# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Introduction
This project harnesses the power of React, TypeScript, and Vite to deliver a high-performance web application development experience. It leverages Vite's efficient bundling approach and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) to ensure rapid development cycles. Additionally, it includes a robust set of ESLint configurations to maintain high code quality.

## Key Features
- **Fast Refresh**: Using official Vite plugins for React that enable state-preserving capabilities during development:
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Integrates Babel to leverage its fast refresh feature.
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Utilizes SWC to provide an alternative approach, focusing on performance improvements.

## Advanced ESLint Configuration
For development environments, especially in production settings, it is advisable to extend the ESLint configuration to include type-aware linting rules. These enhancements ensure stricter type checks and better coding practices, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.

### Configuration Details
1. **Parser Options**:
   Enhance your ESLint parser options to fully leverage TypeScript's capabilities by adding the following settings:

  ```javascript
   export default {
     parserOptions: {
       ecmaVersion: 'latest',
       sourceType: 'module',
       project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
       tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
     },
   }

  ```
2. **Type-Aware Linting**:

  - Upgrade from the basic TypeScript ESLint recommendations to more comprehensive configurations:
    - Replace plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended with plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked for type-checked rules.
    - For even stricter rules, use plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked.
    - Consider adding plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked for style-focused lining.

3. **React Specific Linting**:

  - To ensure adherence to best practices in React development, install the eslint-plugin-react:
    - - Add plugin:react/recommended for recommended React linting rules.
    - - Incorporate plugin:react/jsx-runtime for linting of JSX elements with the React 17 JSX transform.
